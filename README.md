# BMI Calculator

In this project, we are going to write a python program to calculate the BMI.

Measurements:

1. Weight(kgs)

2. Height(m)

BMI = Weight/(Height * Height)

We will use the BMI to determine whether the user is overweight, Normal, or underweight.

## Results:

If BMI > 24 then the person is overweight

If BMI is between 18 and 25 then the person is normal

If BMI < 18 then the person is underweight
